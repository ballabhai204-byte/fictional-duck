# Fictional Duck 🦆✨

## The Legend

In the vast expanse of the cosmos, there exists a legendary creature known only as the Fictional Duck. Unlike ordinary ducks bound by the laws of gravity and ponds, this magnificent being traverses the infinite galaxies, propelled by pure imagination and cosmic quackery.

### The Journey

The Fictional Duck began its journey in the Andromeda Galaxy, where it discovered that reality is merely a suggestion. With each flap of its iridescent wings, it tears through the fabric of spacetime, leaving trails of stardust and bewildered astronomers in its wake.

Some say the duck flies backward through time. Others claim it exists in multiple dimensions simultaneously. The truth? No one really knows. The Fictional Duck operates beyond the constraints of conventional physics.

### Current Mission

The duck is currently on a mission to collect the most absurd things in the universe:
- Photons that refuse to travel at light speed
- Black holes with existential crises
- Stars that forgot how to shine
- Cosmic anomalies that make absolutely no sense

### This Repository

This project is a tribute to the Fictional Duck's cosmic adventures. An interactive experience inspired by a creature that defies all logic and reason.

Just a simple web project. Nothing more. Nothing less.

*The duck watches. The duck knows.*
